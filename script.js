            either read or not yet read.
            To do this there should be a *Form to fill in about Book details
            A button to display this form
            A "Card" div representing every added book
            This Card - Should show all data about book

           JS - Using Objects and prototypes 
           Book Object and Constructor for creating a Book
           All books will be stored in an Array
           Will need a Function to add book to array

           Will need a function that loops through Array and displays books in cards
           Will need Button(OnClick) to show Add book Form
           Will need Button on Card that changes Read Status
           Will need Button on Card to remove said Book/Card (Need to associate with correct card <-> Book)
